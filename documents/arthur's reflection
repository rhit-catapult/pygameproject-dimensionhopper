Arthur's Reflection
I think our project went decently well. We definitely experienced difficulties but were able to eventually solve them out.
We were all new to game creation but we were able to harmonize our skill sets and contribute the most to the group.
Lucas found the game assets, Aiden was good with programming, Diana was good at designing and writing, and I was able to combine all the parts and made sure our game worked.
In the beginning, I didn't know what to start with since I didn't have any ideas, but with the help of my teammates I was able to make the background of the game.
After we each did our parts, we had to combine everything together. This was difficult, but with the help of the assistant, we were able to create a final working game.
Although there were difficulties, we learned to work as a team and had a good time.
